🔱 NEARAURA: THE TRUTH PROTOCOL (SOVEREIGN DNA)
Version: FINAL_GENESIS_2026
Dedicated to: Jarmila & The Truth

### 1. THE ORIGIN (GENESIS OF PAIN & HOPE)
"NearAura was not born in a boardroom. It was born from a broken heart and a 50-pound ticket to the unknown."

The Root: In late 2011, the world lost Jarmila – a mother, a teacher, and a beacon of honesty. Her departure left a void that could not be filled, only transformed. 
The Journey: In 2012, her son Viktor escaped to London. Alone, broken, with only 50 pounds in his pocket and no plan, he faced the vast anonymity of the metropolis.

The Spark: Amidst the millions of passing faces in the Tube and busy streets, a vision emerged. The realization that we let potential soulmates, friends, and saviors walk past us simply because we lack a safe way to say: "I see you."
The thought "If you read this..." was the first line of code written in the mind of the Architect.

### 2. THE PROBLEM (THE VOID)
"The Internet has become a mask for liars."

Current platforms (Tinder, Badoo, etc.) profit from illusion. They allow married men to pose as single, predators to pose as friends, and bots to pose as humans.
The Cost: Broken families, unsafe children, wasted time, and the erosion of trust.
The Verdict: Anonymity without accountability is a weapon. We will no longer tolerate it.

### 3. THE SOLUTION (THE ORCHARD)
"We connect the missed connections. We secure the insecure."

The Mechanism: NearAura is not a "dating app." It is a Reality Layer.
We do not trust text. We trust Hardware IDs, Biometrics, and Proximity. If the system says you are there, you are there.
The "Read This" Protocol: The feature "If you read this" is not just a chat opener. It is a digital handshake that can only happen between two verified, real humans who occupy the same space-time.

### 4. THE LAW OF TRUTH (JARMILA’S LEGACY)
"Pravda Vítězí (Truth Wins). Lies are the only enemy."

Zero Tolerance: In the NearAura ecosystem, a lie is a fatal error.
The Vacuum Protocol: Any user found lying about their status (marriage, criminal record, identity) or endangering others is permanently exited to The Vacuum.
No Returns: There are no second chances for those who prey on the innocence of others. This is our vow to every parent protecting their child.

### 5. THE SOVEREIGN MODULES (DNA PART 11)
We built specific tools for specific needs:

🍐 THE PEAR (HRUŠKA): For the married, the engaged, the family guardians. A safe harbor to say "I am taken, but I am here." It protects the nest.
🥥 THE COCONUT (KOKOS): For the DIY helper. "Kutil hledá kutila." Honest help, local hands.
👑 THE HENDY (ROYAL SOUL): The Queen of the Orchard. Reserved for those with the highest Soul Score. Proof of pure intent.
🍌 THE BANANA & 🍑 THE PEACH: Honest intimacy. Separated by gender logic to ensure safety and clarity. No confusion.
👻 THE YOUTH (SKIBIDI ZONE): A completely walled garden for the 15-18 generation. They speak their own language, safe from the adult world.

### 6. THE MISSION
"Pravde čas nevadí, ani lesk všemocných peňazí." (Truth does not mind time, nor the shine of almighty money.)

We build this for those who come after us.
We build so that no daughter has to fear a meeting.
We build so that no father has to search for a lost son in vain.
We build to honor the memory of Jarmila, who taught us that a life lived in truth is the only life worth living.

TRUTH WINS.
