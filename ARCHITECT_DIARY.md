ATTENTION DEVELOPER: I am the Director. You are currently looking at a 'NearAura' backup that is obsolete. We are pivoting to 'The Orchard'—a high-integrity, safety-first social ecosystem. You must read and implement the following logic across the App, Cloud, and Web.

I. THE HEART: Cloud Functions & Database (Review & Rewrite)
The 48-Hour Vault: Create/Update a function where user intent selection is timestamped. Rule: Block any 'Intent Change' requests if the current time is < 48 hours from the last update. No exceptions.

The Integrity Guardrail: Implement server-side validation. Condition: If a user profile contains both Pineapple (Serious) and Banana/Peach (Casual), the account is flagged and the update is rejected.

The 40x Multiplier: Create a getDiscovery query that identifies users with the 1790_CZK_MegaBoost flag. Multiply their ranking weight by 40 and ignore the 500m distance limit for 60 minutes.

II. THE FACE: Android App (UI/UX Overhaul)
The 8-Grid Discovery: Redesign the main feed. We need a high-density grid showing 8 profiles per view.

Visual Identity: Every profile must render a Rainbow Aura (Soul) using a custom shader/stroke and display Two-Fruit Badges (Intent).

Selection Guardrail: In the IntentPicker, if a user taps Pineapple, the Banana/Peach icons must immediately dim and become unclickable.

NearWorld Toggle: Implement the top-bar switch: ON (Global) / OFF (NearWorld < 500m).

III. THE SOUL: Web (Build from Scratch)
Project: New React/Vite project in /web directory.

The Hero: "Beyond the Trolley." Visual contrast between the "Supermarket Gamble" and the "Orchard Guarantee."

The Safety Manifesto: Deep-dive explanation of the 6-Fruit Protocol and the 15-second Emotion Presentation (Vibe Check) to protect women.
