        <div class="space-y-12 text-slate-300 text-lg leading-relaxed italic">
            <p>A "Vibe" is not a static profile picture. It is a living, breathing frequency. The Rainbow Aura is our architectural response to the flattening of human personality. We recognize that you are a complex spectrum. On any given Tuesday, you might be seeking the 🍈 (Hobbies) of a mountain biker and the 🍇 (Tribe) of a founder. We don't force you into a box; we give you a canvas.</p>
            <p>The Vibe Check happens every 48 hours. When your timer expires, your Aura fades to grey. This is the "Aura Reset." It forces a moment of introspection. You cannot coast on old energy. To reappear on the Radar, you must re-declare your intent: 🍍, 🍇, 🍊, 🍈, 🍒, or 🍌🍑. This ensures that every Vibe you encounter in the Orchard is "Fresh"—synchronised within the last 48 hours. No ghost profiles, no stale data.</p>
            <p>How do we verify a Vibe? Through the Vault. When two Auras synchronize, the system tracks the "Intent Match." If you lock 🍊 (Friends) but your interactions are reported as 🍌🍑 (Intimacy), your Vibe integrity collapses. A low integrity score dims your Aura's brightness on the Radar. In the Orchard, your honesty is your visibility.</p>
